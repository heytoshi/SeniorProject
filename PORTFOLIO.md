This projectâ€™s aim was to create an Android application that give users access to watch RTMP live streams. The focus was to create a more flexible and enhanced alternative version to live streaming applications. Therefore, the application is like Twitch and other social media live streaming applications. It has similar features, such as a media player, social media, chat system and private streaming etc. It was created using Android Studio, Firebase, Nginx and Socket.IO.

The project addresses all four of the Computer Science Learning Goals. The chat client and the chat server implemented by understanding the multithreading process of async programming, therefore, it helped me to understand the levels of CPU cores. The project also involved utilizing multiple languages such as Java, JavaScript and the written algorithms involved writing object-oriented functions. Every object created in different files were referred and utilized to make an algorithm functional. Since, it was a capstone project, it was required to work on the assignment individually. Every encountered problem, testing, debugging, exploring ideas were done alone. For that reason, the student is required to come up with the required data structures to tackle any issues and challenges that come up.
